testing the software or application reapeatly again and again manually in order to find a defect in the software accourdin to the customer requirement is called as maunal testing
test engineer write the code or script or program by using tools like selenium and qtp and run the program against to the application the  tool or program automatically test the application whe give result as a pass or fail is called as automation testing
advantage of manual testing:
software qulaity is good 
program knowledge is not required
disadavatages of manual testing:
resource utlization is more
there will be no consistancy
time taken will be more
its tedious and monotonus job
defect tracking tool:
defect tracking tool is a software 
which is used to mainly for stored or track the defect in centralized place
and communicate defect with developers in organised way
stages of stlc:
system study
prepare test plan
write test case
prepare traceablity matrix
test execution
defect tracking
prepare test execution 
retrospective meeting
write test case procedure:
system study
identify the all the possible scenarios
write test case
testcase review
fix the review
verify the fix
testcase approval
store it in testcase 
stages of sdlc:
requirement collection
feasibility studying
design
coding 
testing
installization
maintanence
types of sdlic:
waterfall model
spiral model
v&v model
prototype model
customized modeel
hybrid model
agile model
types of software testing:
black box testing
white box testing
white box testing:
path testing
conditional testig
loop testing
white box testing memory point of view
white box testing performance point view
black box testing:
functionality testing
integration testing
system testing
acceptance testing
usablility testing
performance testing
smoke testing
ad-hoc testing
accessablity testing
reliablity testing
exploratory testing
comapatability testing
l10n tsting
l18n testing
four types of severity :
blocker 
crictical
major
minor
three types of priority :
high priority
medium priority
low priority
defect:
any feature is not working accourding to the customer requirement is called as defect
deviation from the requirement specification is called as defect
error found in the sotware or application is called as defect
bugs:
its infomal name given to the defect
error:
itis mistake done by the program which will not able to run the program and excute the program
failure:
defect in the software its leads to failure
failure the word is used to enduser and customer
defect status:
new/open
assign
duplicate
postpone/defered
can't be fixed
it's not a defect
issue is not reproduceable
request for enhacements
fixed
closed
reopen
defect report:
release id
build id
build no
requirement number

testcase:
its a document which contains the all the possiple scenarios for specific requirement
which contains different sections be like
step number
actin and description
input
expected result
actual result

design tecnique:
it's technique which is used to while writing the tesecase in order to improve tha tescoverage
types of design technique:
error guessing
equivalence class partion
.pressman rule
.practice method
boundry value analysis
traceability metrix:
it's a document which will make sure that every requirement has got adleast one testcase is called as traceability matrix
also called as cross reference matrix
